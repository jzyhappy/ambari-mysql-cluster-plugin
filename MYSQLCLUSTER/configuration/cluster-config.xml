NoOfReplicas=2    # Number of replicas
DataMemory=80M    # How much memory to allocate for data storage
IndexMemory=18M   # How much memory to allocate for index storage
                  # For DataMemory and IndexMemory, we have used the
                  # default values. Since the "world" database takes up
                  # only about 500KB, this should be more than enough for
                  # this example NDB Cluster setup.
                  # NOTE: IndexMemory is deprecated in NDB 7.6 and later; in
                  # these versions, resources for all data and indexes are 
                  # allocated by DataMemory and any that are set for IndexMemory
                  # are added to the DataMemory resource pool
ServerPort=2202   # This the default value; however, you can use any
                  # port that is free for all the hosts in the cluster
                  # Note1: It is recommended that you do not specify the port
                  # number at all and simply allow the default value to be used
                  # instead
                  # Note2: The port was formerly specified using the PortNumber 
                  # TCP parameter; this parameter is no longer available in NDB
                  # Cluster 7.5.
